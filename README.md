# Broadband and Socio-economic demographics


Developed by DS5110 students at [The Roux Institute](https://roux.northeastern.edu/), Northeastern University, Summer 2022.

Data and guidance provided by [Maine Connectivity Authority](https://www.maineconnectivity.org/) and comes as a continuation of our fellow [DS 5010 spring 2022 class project](https://ds5010.github.io/broadband/).

We used [The US Census Bureau APIs](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html) for the socio-economic datasets.

## Overview

Is there any correlation between broadband connectivity and other socio-economic demographics in the state of Maine?

This repository aims to visualize and demonstrate broadband access in Maine in context of other socio-economic demographics.

The broadband access  and socio-economic demographics varies across Maine, creating the need for county-level and state-level data visuals to provide support for the decision making body and MCA's projects.
